# Recruitment-Management-System

Description:

This repository contains the codebase for a Salesforce Recruitment App built using Apex. The project demonstrates a custom recruitment management solution designed to handle job postings, applications, candidate tracking, and interview scheduling. The app leverages Apex triggers, classes, and custom objects to manage the entire recruitment lifecycle within Salesforce. No third-party integrations were usedâ€”everything is handled through native Salesforce and Apex development.

Features:

Create and manage job openings
Track candidate applications
Automate status updates and notifications
Apex-only solution with best practices in mind (bulkification, triggers, etc.)
